S3 PUBLISH DEMO
=============

INTRODUCTION
  This is a demo about copying objects between buckets and publishing the resulting URL in twitter. This demo covers copying objects and URL generation.  

HOW TO DEMO:
  1. Set the following system properties:
  	a. s3.accessKey. This is the access key of your Amazon Account
    b. s3.secetKey. This is the secret key of your Amazon Account (Do not share it!)
    c. s3.bucketName. This is a test bucket where the objects will be created. Remember that you need to choose a non existing bucket name
  2. Create the bucket where you will copy the objects. You can create it with the "SetupFlow" of the Upload Demo Example.         
  3. Run the "PublishFlow". This will copy an image from a public available S3 bucket to the previously select, using the current local date time
  as part of its name, generate its URL, shorten it with bitly and then publish it into Twitter. 

HOW IT WORKS:
   - A new filename is created based on the current local time using the scripting module. 
   - An object from bucket camaraenclaromeco is copied into the select bucket, using the S3 connector.
   - A URL to the new object is generated using the S3 connector
   - The generated URL is shorten using the bityl connector
   - The resultant URL is posted as a twitter status.

WHAT HAS NOT BEEN DEMO:
    Deletion operations over buckets and objects, object and bucket creation and bucket and versioning listing.
